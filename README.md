# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for my machines!

Mainly only works over macOS but it's been tried and should work
any \*nix type system so long as you have zsh as your main shell
and a vim (or neovim) setup that has lua and python installed
on it.

## Installation instructions:
```console
$ ./install
```
